I’m Pooja M, and this repository contains my Task 1 Presentation prepared for the Cloud Engineer role as part of the Tachyon Systems second-round interview process.

This project summarizes my complete understanding of the Primary and Secondary Topics related to Cloud Engineering.
Through this task, I focused on learning the core cloud fundamentals, AWS and Azure services, Infrastructure-as-Code, and modern DevOps practices used in real-world cloud environments.

My goal is to demonstrate clear conceptual understanding, technical awareness, and problem-solving thinking as a fresher aspiring to become a Cloud Engineer.

This repository reflects my end-to-end understanding of the Cloud Engineer role — covering both the core and supporting cloud concepts.
I have studied each topic with the intent to understand how cloud solutions work in real-world companies like Netflix, Uber, and Amazon.
Though I have not built a live demo, my presentation focuses on deep conceptual understanding, architecture explanation, and practical examples across AWS and Azure platforms
